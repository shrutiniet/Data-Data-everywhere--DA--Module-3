Database: A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. 
# **Data Life Cycle**
 It starts with the right data analysis tool. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software.
 
The life cycle of data is **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy.**

**Plan:** This actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.

**Capture:** This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.   

**Manage:** Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.

**Analyze:** In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals. 

**Archive:** Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.

**Destroy:** To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software.


# Data Analysis Process
1. Ask: The ask phase. In this phase, we do two things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
  **Stakeholders:** Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

2. Prepare: This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. 

3. Process: Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information.

4. Analyze:  Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

5. Share: how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions.

6. Act: This is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem.

# Data Analysis Toolbox
**1. Spreadsheet-** Microsoft Excel sheet OR Google Sheet-- a spreadsheet is a digital worksheet. It stores, organizes, and sorts data. Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called formulas and functions. A formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet. Formulas can do basic things like add, subtract, multiply and divide, but they don't stop there. You can also use formulas to find the average of a number set. 

A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.

**2. Query language:** A query language is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database. SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. SQL is the most widely used structured query language for a couple of reasons. It's easy to understand and works very well with all kinds of databases.

**3. Data Visualization:**  Data visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, and tables. Some popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker. Data analysts like using Tableau because it helps them create visuals that are very easy to understand. This means that even non-technical users can get the information they need. Looker is also popular with data analysts because it gives them an easy way to create visuals based on the results of a query. With Looker, you can give stakeholders a complete picture of your work by showing them visualization data and the actual data related to it.

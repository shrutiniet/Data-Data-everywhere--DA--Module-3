Database: A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. 
# **Data Life Cycle**
 It starts with the right data analysis tool. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software.
 
The life cycle of data is **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy.**

**Plan:** This actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.

**Capture:** This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.   

**Manage:** Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.

**Analyze:** In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals. 

**Archive:** Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.

**Destroy:** To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software.


# Data Analysis Process
1. Ask: The ask phase. In this phase, we do two things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
  **Stakeholders:** Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

2. Prepare: This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. 

3. Process: Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information.

4. Analyze:  Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

5. Share: how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions.

6. Act: This is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem.
